##A brief description of the project
The page works with the unit circle, a fun relic of high school math, or if you are an engineer, something you memorized a long time ago.

The page consists of eight pieces or so:
-drop down menu to pick user name
-welcome page that changes on the hover
-angle drawer
-angle converter
-question A: random angle, multiple choice
-question B: 5 T/F
-question C: 4 T/F
-button to submit your quiz answers
